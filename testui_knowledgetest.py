st.title("üìß Knowledge Test - AI Techniques for Detecting Email Threats")

st.markdown("""
Welcome to the knowledge assessment on machine learning concepts and email threat detection. This brief test is designed to evaluate your understanding of key concepts in this domain through a mix of single and multiple-choice questions.

The assessment consists of 5 questions that cover both theoretical understanding and practical applications. You'll receive immediate feedback on your performance, with a fair scoring system that considers both your correct and incorrect selections. Feel free to trust your intuition - your spontaneous responses often best reflect your true understanding.

At the end of the test, you'll be able to see your score and download your results for future reference. Remember, this is a learning opportunity to help you gauge your knowledge in this field.
