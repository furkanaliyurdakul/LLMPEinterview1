 Welcome back to our course on an Introduction to Cancer Biology. My name is Dr. Ammend, and today we're going to be talking about the genetics of cancer. By the end of this session, you'll be able to describe the contribution of genes to the risk and growth of cancer. You'll be able to describe what a gene is, distinguish between inherited and somatic mutation, and compare and contrast oncogenes and tumor suppressors. You'll be able to use all of this information to then describe how cancer is a genetic disease. To start off with, we'll just be going through a basic introduction to genetics. Cancer is a genetic disease, and it's caused by an accumulation of detrimental variation to the genome. It's important to remember that a single mutation is not sufficient to induce cancer formation. But before we can start to understand how cancer is a genetic disease, we need to first understand what a gene is. So, a gene was first described by Gregor Mendel. He was an Austrian monk, and he's known as the father of genetics. He studied pea plants, he studied their shape, their color, and their height, and first published his findings in 1866. So, this idea of genes and genetics is certainly not a new one. He described that a gene is a discrete unit of heredity of a living organism. In molecular biology, we describe gene as a region of DNA that encodes for a functional product. What we mean by a functional product is RNA or protein. Humans have about 25,000 genes in the genome, and the genome just describes all of the genes of an organism. So, let's unpack this a little bit. What is DNA? DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid, and it's present in the nucleus of most cells of the body. DNA provides instructions for all processes of the body, and is made up of bases that bind to each other to form a twisted ladder, which is known as the double helix. What you can see in the cartoon on your left is an ideogram of what this twisted ladder looks like. Thymidine, the T, is binding to adenine, A, and the C, cytosine, is binding to guanine, G. And again, these four bases represent the bases that make up DNA. Every time a cell divides, it must replicate its DNA in order to pass on the instructions for life to its daughter cells. In a single nucleus of a cell, five to six feet of DNA is contained. So, how can so much DNA be packed in such a small area without getting tangled and broken during replication? Organisms have solved this problem by packing DNA into chromosomes, which you can see in the fluorescence in situ hybridization, or fish, that is on the right. What you see on the right are chromosomes 1 through 22 of humans, plus the sex chromosomes, in this case, two Xs. You'll notice that there are two for every chromosome number. This is because humans are diploid. They have two copies of every gene. There's one maternal and one paternal. And all of the genes of an organism contained in these chromosomes make up the genome. So, then how does the information from DNA that makes up a gene become an observable trait? And that observable trait we call a phenotype. This is explained by what's known as the central dogma of molecular biology. It usually goes that DNA goes to RNA goes to protein. So, let's unpack that a little bit. Every time a cell divides, it replicates its DNA. It makes a copy of its DNA to then give to its daughter cells. This DNA stays in the nucleus, except during cell division, in order to protect it. That way, we don't have more and more errors arise in the DNA over time. The RNA is the code of DNA genes. So, it's transcribed or copied from the DNA. So, this is then exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm. This code, this copy of the code, the RNA, is then translated into protein. And proteins are what does the work of the cell. So, proteins make up the structure of the cell. They're important for signal transduction for communication and metabolism in the cell. So, then how do different types of cells do different things? Why isn't an eye cell a liver cell? Remember, every single cell in the body contains the same type of DNA. DNA. The way an eye cell and a liver cell are different are because even though every cell has the same DNA, only a subset of genes are then transcribed into RNA. And this is described in the field of epigenetics. So, we can make an analogy then between genetics, genes, and epigenetics when we think about traffic patterns. On the image to your left, you see cars driving on a road with traffic lights. In this case, the road describes the DNA genes. It's the same for everybody. The traffic pattern, or where the cars are actually going on the road, describes gene expression. The traffic lights regulate which cars get to drive where. It regulates which genes are transcribed into RNA in every cell. And this is known as epigenetic regulation. So, this is a good time to take a break. And when we come back, we'll talk about genetic variation and mutation. So, welcome back. In this section, we'll be talking about genetic variation and mutation. Let's come back to our first idea of cancer as a genetic disease. Cancer is caused by an accumulation of detrimental variation in the genome. So, what is that detrimental variation in the first place, and where does it come from? It's important to remember that most genetic variation is benign. And really, it's a very good thing to have in a population. The vast majority of our genomes are the same person to person, about 99.5%. That remainder, 0.5%, is variable in the human population. This variation is very small. Only one or a few bases of the DNA vary at any particular location. And those are known as polymorphisms, or single nucleotide polymorphisms, also called SNPs. The variation in our genomes accounts for our individuality. It describes why we look different from each other, why we look slightly different from our parents or children. And no one shares the exact copy of your DNA. Even your alleles may differ from each other. One variant on your maternal allele, and a different variant on your paternal allele. So then, what's a mutation? A mutation is one of the few detrimental genetic variation that increases risk to developing a disease, or in rare diseases, actually causes the disease itself. When someone says that they have a cancer gene, what they actually mean is that they have a mutation in a gene that can increase cancer risk. There are two different types of so-called cancer genes, oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Oncogenes promote cancer. So in a normal healthy cell, expression of oncogenes is low, while in a cancer cell, expression of oncogenes is high. This is in contrast to tumor suppressors, which protect against cancer. So in normal cells, you'd have high expression of tumor suppressors, and in cancer cells, you would have low expression of tumor suppressors. Let's go back to our analogy of cars driving on a road. To prevent a crash, you need to both accelerate with the gas or stop with the brakes. But a balance of the two is important. This is true in normal cells. So in this case, the gas is oncogenes, and the brakes are tumor suppressors. And in cancer cells, these are both misregulated. There are two types of mutation. Activating mutation causes the gene to be expressed at the wrong time, at the wrong level, or even with a new function. So this means that activating mutations in oncogenes are tumorigenic. Their converse are inactivating mutations. And these cause reduced function of a gene, so either less RNA or protein is made. And inactivating mutations in tumor suppressors are tumorigenic. So we'll go ahead and take a break now. And when we come back, we'll talk about two-hit hypothesis and genomic instability. Welcome back. In this section, we'll be talking about two-hit hypothesis and genomic instability, and really where those mutations come from in the first place. So you can acquire mutations two different ways, either through somatic mutation or germline mutation. Somatic mutations are acquired by somatic cells, which are all the cells of the body except eggs or sperm. And those mutations are passed on to daughter cells during cell proliferation. It is important to remember that these mutations cannot be inherited by offspring. Every time a cell divides, it must replicate its DNA. And errors just get made by chance. So you'll remember what we talked about before, with a lot of DNA packed into a very small area. So just by chance, about one mutation is made every 10 billion Bayes pairs. There is an increase in DNA damage and subsequent replication error due to environmental carcinogens as well. These include UV damage, which is also shown in the cartoon to the right, where an incoming UV photon hits the DNA and damages it, so that it causes nicks in the DNA, which you can see to the far right, which then have to be repaired by the cell. And this can cause an increased risk to skin cancer. Similarly, smoking causes chemical damage to lung cells, and hepatitis and alcohol abuse can lead to damaging cirrhosis of liver cells. You might remember these from another lecture where Dr. Panta discussed the risks to different cancers. The other way you can get mutations is by inheriting them. And these are called germline mutations or inherited mutations. And these mutations are present in the germ cell. So in this case, that's the egg or the sperm, and are inherited by offspring. So it's just the genetic variation that we're born with. Germline variation accounts for why offspring look similar but not identical to their parents. When cancer is said to run in families, it may be due to these inherited mutations. For example, women who inherit a BRCA1-2 mutation are at increased risk for breast cancer. And individuals who inherit a CDH1 mutation are at increased risk for stomach cancer. But not all women who inherit a BRCA1-2 mutation develop breast cancer. How does that work? This is where it becomes important to remember that cancer is caused by an accumulation of detrimental variation in the genome. The biggest risk factor for developing cancer is aging. Over time, we accumulate mutations. And this either happens by random replication error or by increased replication error due to carcinogens that cause DNA damage, as we discussed before. The two-hit hypothesis describes why not all women with a BRCA1-2 mutation get breast cancer. You'll remember that humans are diploid. We have two copies of every gene, one maternal and one paternal. This means that even if one copy of a gene or allele is mutated, the other copy can allow the protein to operate normally. In order for a gene to be cancer-inducing, both copies of the gene must be affected. The second so-called hit may alter the DNA directly via mutation, or it may alter the expression of the DNA via an epigenetic mechanism. So let's walk through an example of this. We'll walk through the top tree first. On the far left, you can see a parent who, with his partner, passed on two normal copies of a gene to their child. Over the lifetime of this individual, he accumulates mutations, including one hit in the gene shown here. Importantly, the other copy of the gene that was normal but did not have a mutation allowed it to be expressed normally. Eventually, however, this individual acquired another mutation in the same gene, and this resulted in the gene becoming a cancer-causing genetic mutant. In the bottom example, we see an example of inherited or germline mutation, causing increased risk to an individual over a lifetime. In this case, the parents passed on one mutated copy of the gene and one normal copy of the gene. In this case, as the individual progresses through life, he only needs one additional hit in order for the gene to be cancer-causing. Most cancer requires mutations in multiple different types of genes. In order to survive, a cancer cell must overcome normal regulation of cell proliferation, cell survival, and cellular communication, and other so-called hallmarks of cancer that will be discussed by Dr. Zarif in a later lecture. Each of these processes are tightly regulated in normal cells by multiple redundant pathways. This means that in order to become cancerous, a cell must accumulate mutations in multiple of these pathways. It's been described as usually a minimum of six to seven in multiple different genes. So you can see an example of this to the far right. At the top, we see a normal cell where a mutation has inactivated a tumor suppressor gene, so we see increased proliferation. This cell doesn't become malignant yet, though. First, it undergoes mutation that inactivates DNA repair genes, an additional mutation that activates an oncogene, and then mutations that inactivate several different tumor suppressor genes that then induce it to become cancer. In addition, cancer cells show a great deal of genomic instability. Genomic instability describes how cells can survive and divide with higher rates of mutation than in normal cells. So in a normal cell, DNA replication error results in programmed cell death, or apoptosis, which you can see in the lighter colored box over to your right. In a cancer cell, that same DNA replication error with the same DNA replication error, cells continue to divide and pass that mutation on to daughter cells. Over time, these mutations in these repair pathways will accumulate since cells never undergo that programmed cell death, and the frequency of mutation in the cancer cell genome increases. This increase in mutation rate leads to tumor cell heterogeneity and is one of the reasons why cancer patients become resistant to treatment. This brings us to the end of our lecture. I hope this gave you a good understanding of the basics of genetics in order to better understand the rest of this lecture series and introduction to cancer biology.
